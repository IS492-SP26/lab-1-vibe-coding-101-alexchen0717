I employed Gemini CLI for Tool A and Cursor for Tool B. Regarding the code quality, both tools generated functional turtle Python commands. However, Cursor's output included better implementation 
Details like a screen on timer for smoother gameplay. Regarding the speed of generation, Gemini CLI was faster to start with since it worked directly in the terminal without opening up a full
IDE. Regarding the ease of use, Gemini CLI provides pretty straightforward commands, yet Cursor provides a better visual environment for running and debugging the code at the same time. 
Regarding debugging and error handling, Gemini requires the manual copying of errors back into the prompt. Cursor allowed for "Chat-to-fix" directly within the IDE, which was much faster. 
Regarding flexibility and customization, tool A is good for generating the "base" prototype quickly, and tool B is better for fine-tuning specific features.
